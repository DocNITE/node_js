What is it?
It's my first (or not) attempt for create web application (web server + frontend sied (aka server/client)). 
But, for some reason, i drop it. There was a few dirty moments, what i dont like...

# How to build?
1. Clone project
2. Run `npm i` in CLI
3. When you initialize node modules, now build & start the server with `node run start-build` 
4. Connect to your website and to do something...
